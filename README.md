# NP-Complete Problems for the defense of the Water Tribe.

## Introduction

In this project we seek to solve a problem that is presented to us with 3 different techniques, these are, "Backtracking", "Linear Programming" and "Approximation".

In this case, the problem we are solving is "NP-Complete".

For this work, an exhaustive report was made, going through all the important points of the process until the "optimal" solution was obtained.

All project analysis is located in the "Report" folder.

# Explanation of each folder

First of all, this was a project for the university, so the code is written in spanish.

With this clarified, we move on to the report.

## Report

In this folder you will find the project report in "pdf" format.

## ReadyToRun

In this folder are the 5 ".py" that were made for the project and all the test files used.

This folder is used to facilitate the execution of the programs when testing their operation.

## Programs

In this folder are the 5 ".py" made for the project.

## Tests

In this folder are all the tests used for the project, both those provided by the chair and their own.

# Explanation of execution

To execute the programs and check their operation, you must follow the following steps:
- Download the "ReadyToRun" folder in its entirety.
- Enter from the "Linux" console (Or the operating system of preference with its own commands) to the downloaded directory.
- Execute the command "backtracking.py", "plineal.py", "aproximacion1.py", "aproximacion2.py" or "graficos.py" depending on the program you want to use.

## Program "backtracking.py"

This program is the one requested by the statement, it contains the "Backtracking Algorithm" that solves the problem posed optimally.

Once the "python3 backtracking.py" command has been executed, the program will ask for the name of the file you want to use. This must respect the structure provided by "the tests of the chair."

The file name must be entered without the ".txt", for example, if you wanted to use the file named "10_3.txt", you should only enter it through the terminal "10_3".

After entering the file name, the program will be executed to solve the problem, and will display both the result obtained and the order followed in the console.

## Program "plineal.py"

This program is the one requested by the statement, it contains the "Linear Programming Algorithm (Model)" that solves the problem posed optimally.

Once the "python3 plineal.py" command has been executed, the program will ask for the name of the file you want to use. This must respect the structure provided by "the tests of the chair."

The file name must be entered without the ".txt", for example, if you wanted to use the file named "10_3.txt", you should only enter it through the terminal "10_3".

After entering the file name, the program will be executed to solve the problem, and will display both the result obtained and the order followed in the console.

## Program "aproximacion1.py"

This program is the one requested by the statement, it contains the "Approximation Algorithm" that solves the problem posed approximately.

Once the "python3 aproximacion1.py" command has been executed, the program will ask for the name of the file you want to use. This must respect the structure provided by "the tests of the chair."

The file name must be entered without the ".txt", for example, if you wanted to use the file named "10_3.txt", you should only enter it through the terminal "10_3".

After entering the file name, the program will be executed to solve the problem, and will display both the result obtained and the order followed in the console.

## Program "aproximacion2.py"

This program is optionally requested, it contains a "Greedy Approximation Algorithm" that solves the posed problem approximately.

Once the "python3 aproximacion2.py" command has been executed, the program will ask for the name of the file you want to use. This must respect the structure provided by "the tests of the chair."

The file name must be entered without the ".txt", for example, if you wanted to use the file named "10_3.txt", you should only enter it through the terminal "10_3".

After entering the file name, the program will be executed to solve the problem, and will display both the result obtained and the order followed in the console.

## Program "graficos.py"

This program allows us to create graphics with the "Matplotlib" tool.

Once the command "python3 graficos.py" has been executed, the program will ask for the name of the file you want to use. This must respect the structure provided by "the tests of the chair."

The file name must be entered without the ".txt", for example, if you wanted to use the file named "10_3.txt", you should only enter it through the terminal "10_3".

After entering the name of the file, the program will print on the screen the graph obtained that represents the "Computational Complexity" of said execution (where the trend towards computational complexity theoretically analyzed in the report is seen).

When you close the graphic printed on the screen, the program will terminate.

## Program "funciones.py"

This program simply has all the algorithms together, and is where the graphics tool imports the programs from.
